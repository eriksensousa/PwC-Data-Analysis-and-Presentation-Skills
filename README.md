### Applied Learning Project

This specialization will include a project at the end of each module and a capstone project at the end of the specialization.  Each project will provide you the chance to apply the skills of that lesson.  In the first module you'll plan an analysis approach, in the second and third modules you will analyze sets of data using the Excel skills you learn.  In the fourth module you will prepare a business presentation.

In the final Capstone Project, you'll apply the skills you’ve learned by working through a mock client business problem. You'll analyze a set of data, looking for the business insights. Then you'll create and visualize your findings, before recording a video to present your recommendations to the client.
